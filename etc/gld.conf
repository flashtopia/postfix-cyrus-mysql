#
# How many seconds we should wait before accepting
# a mail that is in the greylist. (default is 60)
#
MINTIME=60

#
# Shall we use lightgrey option ? (0=No,1=Yes) (default is 0)
#
# The lightgrey option, mask the last octet of IP addresses
# and thus we greylist only C classes (/24) instead of individual IPs.
#
LIGHTGREY=0

#
# Shall we use the mxgrey algorithm ? (0=No,1=Yes) (default is 0)
#
# the mxgrey algorithm is a variation of the greylist algorithm.
# When this is enabled, we allow all incoming mails from an IP address
# whatever source/destination email as long as this IP has been greylisted
# one time and succeded the mail resend .
#
# Example:
# The IP 1.2.3.4 sends an email from src@domain.com to user@yourdomain.com
# We greylist this mail as this IP is not yet in database and send a 450 SMTP code
# After some time, the IP re-send the mail from src@domain.com to user@yourdomain.com
# We update the db.
# Some time after the ip 1.2.3.4 sends an email from john@domain.com to fred@yourdomain.com
# We will accept this mail without any greylisting, as this ip already succeded a greylist test
# and thus seems to be a valid smtp server and not a spammer .
#
# The advantage of this method, is that it reduce the re-send time due to greylisting to
# one mail per server instead of one mail per destination .
#
# Please, note that enabling this feature automaticly enable the UPDATE feature.
#
MXGREY=1

#
# Shall we use lightgrey on domains ? (0=No,1=Yes) (default is 0)
#
# lightgreydomain
# after a normal triplet (full sender, full recipient, IP) has
# verified and email passed, create a domain triplet
# sender domain, recipient domain, IP
# match future emails against domain triplet.  The user triplet
# can then expire from the database
# This means at least one normal greylist has to be verified
# and then future emails between domains aren't delayed
#
# Do not activate this feature without understanding it ....
#
LIGHTGREYDOMAIN=1

#
# Shall we use the whitelist table ?  (0=No,1=Yes) (default is 1)
#
# If set to yes, then the table 'whitelist' is looked up
# each time postfix request the server
# if the email/domain/ip is in the whitelist, then the response
# will be 'dunno' .
#
# In the whitelist table, you can set the following values:
# an email: ie john@foo.tld
# a domain: ie @bar.tld
# an IP   : ie 1.2.3.4
# a subnet: ie 1.2.3
#
WHITELIST=1

#
# Shall we use a DNS based whitelist ? (default is no)
#
# To activate it, the line must be uncommented
# and the value set to the domain of the DNS whitelist.
# for example, if DNSWL is set to toto.com and we get a mail from ip a.b.c.d
# then gld will DNS lookup d.c.b.a.toto.com
# and if found allow the ip without greylisting it.
# 
#DNSWL=toto.com

#
# Shall we send a 'dunno' in case of error (mysql down,....) (0=No,1=Yes) (default is 1)
#
# Normaly, if an error occur, the server is supposed to close the connection
# and thus postfix will return a 450 Server configuration error
# if this parameter is set to 1, then the server will return 'dunno'
# and thus let postfix decide the fate of the mail.
#
ERRACCEPT=1

#
# Shall we update the database (0=No,1=Yes) (default is 1)
#
# If set to yes, the fields 'last' and 'n' are updated each time
# a request is done by postfix, this is not needed by the greylist algorithm
# and thus can be disabled.
# The interest of those 2 fields is to help admins to clean up the table.
# Of course, disabling this will increase performance.
# If you disable this feature, you won't be able to use the -c option
# to clean up the database.
#
UPDATE=1

#
# Shall we log to the syslog (0=No,1=Yes) (default is 1)
#
SYSLOG=1

#
# If we use syslog, which facility shall we use (default is mail)
# it can only be one of the following facilities:
# daemon mail local0 local1 local2 local3 local4 local5 local6 local7
#
FACILITY=mail

#
# The Message that we display in case of reject (default is "Greylisted")
#
# If you want another SMTP return code than the default 450, just put it at
# the beginning of the message, ie: 451 You have been greylisted by gld ...
# If you don't provide any SMTP code, the default 450 will be used by postfix
#
MESSAGE=Service temporarily unavailable, please try later

#
# Shall we keep a persistant connexion to the db ? (0=No,1=Yes) (default is 1)
#
# If disabled, gld will connect/disconnect to the db at each fork
# If enabled, gld will use the same connexion for all childs .
#
# Enabling this feature should improve performances, but it may not
# be supported cleanly on all db, so you can disable it .
